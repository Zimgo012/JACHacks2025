## Project: PetoVibe

### Describe

A full web application that combines "vibe-based searching" (using Google's Gemini API for analyzing and determining user vibes) with a pet adoption platform.

The goal is to match users with animals/pets that suit their vibe and personal taste, similar to a dating app (like Tinder) but for finding pets.
